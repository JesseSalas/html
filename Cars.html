</p><p align="center"><img src="./Cars_files/Mustang Boss.jpg" width="225" height="170"></p> <br>
<p> </p><p align="center"> This is a 2012 Ford Mustang Boss. I like ford more than all the other car companies because my family does, and they seem better.
<br> It has 444 horsepower and it weighs around 3,480 pounds. It's top speed is 155 mph, and it gets up to 60 mph in 4 seconds. It also has better handling than most high powered cars.

<br><p align="center"><img src="./Cars_files/Camaro.jpg" width="225" height="170"></p> <br>
<p> </p><p align="center"> This is the Camaro, a chevy car. Camaros are my favorite types of cars because I think they look the best.
<br> It was a different car before 1966, but they made the camaro for a better car overall. It has become it's own name, and is getting better by the year.
